# Lab 04 - Express server

Before we can do anything. We have to run `npm install` to install our dependencies as described in `package.json`
You can run the server using command `node index.js`, you can stop it using CTRL + C. Don't forget to restart after doing changes.
Or you can run `npm start`, obeserve the command nodemon in the package.json for the start. The app will reload automatically for you now.

1. Download POSTMAN so you can do POST request https://www.postman.com/downloads/ (you don't need to register)
2. Do the tasks in index.js

You can check that you have correct code by running command `npm run test` and scroll trough the results. 

## Bonus
You can do bonus.js for 1 extra point.
